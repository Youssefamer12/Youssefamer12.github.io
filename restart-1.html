                        Hi! I am Youssef Amer, pleased to meet you! I am a 31 years old man of Algerian and Lithuanian decent.
                        I currently work part-time as a bartender and Uber driver while currently being enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
                        My goal upon completion of the course in six months I will be entering the field of web design.

                        Some of my interests are sports, music, comedy, movies and television.
                        My favorite sports teams are the New York Jets, New York Rangers, New York Red Bull, Chelsea FC, New York Mets and New York Knicks.
                        I listen to almost every differnt genre of music, the only music I really don't like is commercial country music. 
                        Some of my favorite artists include Bruce Sprinsteen, Eminem, The Dirty Heads, Biggie and the Beatles.

                    <br>
                        I enjoy every single type of comedy you could possibly think of, and I even performed stand-up for a few years in NYC and northern New Jersey. In my opinion SNL is the greatest show in the history of televison. 
                        When it comes to movies and television, my taste are as varied as my music taste. I love everything from Goodfellas to Julie and Julia to Monsters INC., and everything in between.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        My hobbies include playing hockey, writting music and supporting my local football (yes its football, not soccer) club, the New York Red Bull, with my supporters club, the Garden State Ultras.
